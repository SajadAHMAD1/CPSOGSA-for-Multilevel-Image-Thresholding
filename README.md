# CPSOGSA-for-Multilevel-Image-Thresholding

Abstract: 

CPSOGSA is employed to find the optimal pixels in the benchmark images
Image segmentation is one of the pivotal steps in image processing. Actually, it deals
with the partitioning of the image into different classes based on pixel intensities.
This work introduces a new image segmentation method based on the constriction
coefficient-based particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm
(CPSOGSA). The random samples of the image act as searcher agents of the
CPSOGSA algorithm. The optimal number of thresholds is determined using Kapur's
entropy method. The effectiveness and applicability of CPSOGSA in image segmentation
is accomplished by applying it to five standard images from the USC-SIPI
image database, namely Aeroplane, Cameraman, Clock, Lena, and Pirate. Various performance
metrics are employed to investigate the simulation outcomes, including
optimal thresholds, standard deviation, MSE (mean square error), run time analysis,
PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio), best fitness value calculation, convergence maps,
segmented image graphs, and box plot analysis. Moreover, image accuracy is
benchmarked by utilizing SSIM (structural similarity index measure) and FSIM (feature
similarity index measure) metrics. Also, a pairwise non-parametric signed Wilcoxon
rank-sum test is utilized for statistical verification of simulation results. In addition,
the experimental outcomes of CPSOGSA are compared with eight different algorithms
including standard PSO, classical GSA, PSOGSA, SCA (sine cosine algorithm),
SSA (salp swarm algorithm), GWO (grey wolf optimizer), MFO (moth flame optimizer),
and ABC (artificial bee colony). The simulation results clearly indicate that the hybrid
CPSOGSA has successfully provided the best SSIM, FSIM, and threshold values to
the benchmark images.
